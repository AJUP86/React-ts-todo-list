This is a tutorial that  i had coded along  in order to learn the basics of Typescript using React. 

I noticed that they way the original app could be improve. For example passsing props from the top component to nested children of children, so as my contribution i had created a context that serve the functionality to the entire react tree. 

Yo will find the original repo here: https://github.com/piyush-eon/react-typescript-taskify
